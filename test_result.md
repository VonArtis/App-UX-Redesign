# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Text for 'VonVault', 'Sign In', 'Create Account', and terms properly translates. 2) Login Screen has a language selector in the top-right corner, with 'Welcome Back', 'Email Address', 'Password', validation messages, and account creation text properly translated. 3) Sign Up Screen has a language selector in the top-right corner with all form labels and validation messages properly translated. 4) Dashboard Screen has a globe icon language selector in the header area that shows current language flag and properly translates 'Dashboard' and welcome text. 5) Profile Screen has a full dropdown in the 'Language & Region' section that properly translates all profile text. 6) Language persistence is implemented using localStorage for consistent experience across screens and page refreshes. UI testing was not possible due to preview unavailability, but code analysis confirms proper implementation with good translation quality for Spanish and French."

        comment: "Tested the signup and profile workflow to debug the issue where user details aren't saved and membership status doesn't load when skipping verification. Found that the signup process works correctly and user data is properly saved in localStorage. The skip verification flow also works as expected, with the user being able to skip email verification, SMS verification, and 2FA setup. However, there are issues with accessing the profile screen. When trying to click on 'Profile & Settings' in the dashboard, the element was not found. When trying to log in with a created user, we were redirected to the email verification screen instead of the dashboard. The user data is correctly stored in localStorage, but there seems to be an issue with the navigation to the profile screen and possibly with the membership status loading."

    message: "Analyzed the reported issues with the VonVault DeFi platform through code examination. I was unable to directly test the UI due to authentication challenges, but I've identified the following issues based on code analysis:

1. New Investment Button - Still Spinning: The issue is likely in the fetchInvestmentData function in MakeNewInvestmentScreen.tsx. While the code properly sets loading=false in the finally block, there may be API connectivity issues or authentication problems preventing the data from being fetched successfully.

2. Available Plans Button - Not Functioning: This is actually not a bug. The 'Available Plans' element in DashboardScreen.tsx (lines 366-371) is designed as a display card, not a clickable button. It's meant to show the number of available plans, not navigate anywhere.

3. Active Investments Button - Not Functioning: Similar to Available Plans, this is also not a bug. The 'Active Investments' element (lines 372-378) is designed as a display card, not a clickable button. It's meant to show the number of active investments, not navigate anywhere.

4. My Investments - Should Show Real Data: The InvestmentsScreen.tsx component fetches data from the API, but may be failing due to authentication issues or API connectivity problems. The code properly handles empty states, but real data may not be loading.

5. Crypto Deposit Access: In CryptoWalletScreen.tsx, the 'Deposit Crypto' button (lines 221-227) should be visible when a wallet is connected. The issue may be that the wallet connection status is not being properly detected, or the navigation to CryptoDepositScreen is not working correctly.". The SMS Verification screen displays country code selector with multiple options, validates phone input, sends verification codes, and shows a countdown timer for resend. The OTP input component works correctly with auto-focus between fields and paste support. The Verification Success screen shows celebration animation, verification status, and action buttons.

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the multi-wallet management API endpoints and enhanced crypto endpoints. All multi-wallet management endpoints are working correctly: POST /api/wallets/connect successfully connects new wallets with different types, GET /api/wallets returns all user wallets with proper structure, PUT /api/wallets/{wallet_id} successfully updates wallet names, DELETE /api/wallets/{wallet_id} correctly removes wallets and auto-assigns a new primary when needed, and POST /api/wallets/{wallet_id}/primary properly sets a wallet as primary. The 5-wallet limit is correctly enforced, and duplicate wallet addresses are prevented. All enhanced crypto endpoints are also working correctly: GET /api/crypto/deposit-addresses/{wallet_id} returns deposit addresses for all supported networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC), GET /api/crypto/balances/{wallet_id} returns balances for the specific wallet, and POST /api/crypto/transactions/{wallet_id} successfully creates transactions from the specified wallet. The migration from single wallet to multi-wallet works correctly, and backward compatibility with existing endpoints is maintained."
